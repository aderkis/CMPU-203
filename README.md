# CMPU-203

To do (not all will be possible or completed):

For turn-in:
-sprites for all characters
-main menu (with story mode unselectable)
-mode for Battle Rush (this will be turn-in version)
--fight pre-made enemies one after another

More ambitious goals:
-adventure/story mode
--more interesting overworld with panning camera and graphics indicating a diverse map (very unlikely)
